  "about-excerpt": "Hi, I'm Tomas De Backer – a Belgian racing driver. I've got what it takes to reach the top in (international) motorsport. I visited the Circuit Zolder and Spa-Francorchamps when I was just two years old, and I was bitten by the racing bug right away. Ever since, my motorsport career has gone from strength to strength, culminating in the Benelux title in the 2022 Ford Fiesta Sprint Cup.",

  "about-p1": "Hi, I'm Tomas De Backer – a Belgian racing driver who's got what it takes to reach the top in (international) motorsport. I visited the Circuit Zolder and Spa-Francorchamps when I was just two years old, and I was bitten by the racing but right away. From that moment on, racing was an inescapable part of my life.",
  "about-p2": "I made my first ventures into the world of racing by watching and helping where I could (with the cars and the racing drivers who drove for my dad Eddy De Backer's team). Eventually I launched my own career – first in karting, and then in motorsport.",
  "about-p3": "In 2009, I started karting at the Antwerp Karting club in Wilrijk. I took lessons for a while and entered club championships. The Belgian/Dutch GK4 championship and Benelux IAME championship were my first forays into the big time. Between 2010 and 2015, I was champion a total of 5 times in 5 different categories.",
  "about-p4": "In 2011, as the youngest participant, I made it to the final of a competition organised by the energy drink company Red Bull, with rental karts in Eupen.",
  "about-p5": "2014 was another highlight of my career. As the youngest competitor again, I reached the final of a simulator competition organised by Renault Belgium/Luxembourg. I drove a Renault Clio Cup on the big Spa-Francorchamps F1 circuit.",
  "about-p6": "In 2017 and 2018 I made my leap into motorsport, with the Conrad Mazda MX-5 Cup. This was the biggest and most competitive sponsored trophy in the Netherlands at the time. From the very first race, I kept right up with the front group. I took the rookie title in my first season with a huge lead. In 2018, I ended in 3rd place in the overall standings with 11 podium finishes.",
  "about-p7": "In the 2019 season, I was offered an amazing opportunity by Italian karting brand Haase Kart. I was the only Benelux driver in my age category to receive that kind of support that year. In fact, I raced in the Belgian/Dutch GK4 championship for the chassis development.",
  "about-p8": "From the 2020 season, I competed in the Belgian Ford Fiesta Sprint Cup, the cup that's famous for launching the careers of talented young drivers. I won the junior title in my first season, finishing as the vice-champion overall – a great start to an incredibly successful period for me.",
  "about-p9": "Unfortunately, the 2021 season brought a lot of mechanical bad luck. This kept me stuck in 3rd place overall. Ironically, it was the season where I had the most wins and pole positions.",
  "about-p10": "The 2022 season was the ultimate culmination of all the previous seasons' hard work, and I won the overall Belgian title as well as the Belgian junior title. I also took the overall Dutch/Belgium Superstar title. At 10 wins and 13 podiums out of 14 races, this was an unprecedented feat in the history of the Belgian Fiesta Cup.",
