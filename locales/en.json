  "about-excerpt": "Hi, I'm Tomas De Backer – a Belgian racing driver. I've got what it takes to reach the top in (international) motorsport. I visited the Circuit Zolder and Spa-Francorchamps when I was just two years old, and I was bitten by the racing bug right away. Ever since, my motorsport career has gone from strength to strength, culminating in the Benelux title in the 2022, 2023 & 2024 Ford Fiesta Sprint Cup.",

  "about-p1": "Hi, I'm Tomas De Backer – a Belgian racing driver who's got what it takes to reach the top in (international) motorsport. I visited the Circuit Zolder and Spa-Francorchamps when I was just two years old, and I was bitten by the racing but right away. From that moment on, racing was an inescapable part of my life.",
  "about-p2": "I made my first ventures into the world of racing by watching and helping where I could (with the cars and the racing drivers who drove for my dad Eddy De Backer's team). Eventually I launched my own career – first in karting, and then in motorsport.",
  "about-p3": "In 2009, I started karting at the Antwerp Karting club in Wilrijk. I took lessons for a while and entered club championships. The Belgian/Dutch GK4 championship and Benelux IAME championship were my first forays into the big time. Between 2010 and 2015, I was champion a total of 5 times in 5 different categories.",
  "about-p4": "In 2011, as the youngest participant, I made it to the final of a competition organised by the energy drink company Red Bull, with rental karts in Eupen.",
  "about-p5": "2014 was another highlight of my career. As the youngest competitor again, I reached the final of a simulator competition organised by Renault Belgium/Luxembourg. I drove a Renault Clio Cup on the big Spa-Francorchamps F1 circuit.",
  "about-p6": "In 2017 and 2018 I made my leap into motorsport, with the Conrad Mazda MX-5 Cup. This was the biggest and most competitive sponsored trophy in the Netherlands at the time. From the very first race, I kept right up with the front group. I took the rookie title in my first season with a huge lead. In 2018, I ended in 3rd place in the overall standings with 11 podium finishes.",
  "about-p7": "In the 2019 season, I was offered an amazing opportunity by Italian karting brand Haase Kart. I was the only Benelux driver in my age category to receive that kind of support that year. In fact, I raced in the Belgian/Dutch GK4 championship for the chassis development.",
  "about-p8": "From the 2020 season, I competed in the Belgian Ford Fiesta Sprint Cup, the cup that's famous for launching the careers of talented young drivers. I won the junior title in my first season, finishing as the vice-champion overall – a great start to an incredibly successful period for me.",
  "about-p9": "Unfortunately, the 2021 season brought a lot of mechanical bad luck. This kept me stuck in 3rd place overall. Ironically, it was the season where I had the most wins and pole positions.",
  "about-p10": "The 2022 season was the ultimate culmination of all the previous seasons' hard work, and I won the overall Belgian title as well as the Belgian junior title. I also took the overall Dutch/Belgium Superstar title. At 10 wins and 13 podiums out of 14 races, this was an unprecedented feat in the history of the Belgian Fiesta Cup.",
  "about-p11": "In the 2023 season, an unofficial Ford Fiesta Sprint Cup Benelux championship was organized for the first time. No more separate rankings, but one general classification. After 7 race weekends and 14 races, I could crown myself champion again! With 7 victories and 12 podiums, it was another truly successful season!",
  "about-p12": "Furthermore, I got to know the BMW M2 CS Racing Cup Benelux. Here too, I immediately scored 2 podiums in my debut weekend! Last but not least, I also made my debut in endurance racing! With a trip to the Portimao circuit in Portugal for the 24H C1 Eurocup.",
  "about-p13": "The 2024 season was once again an unforgettable season. With 8 victories in 12 races and a 3rd consecutive title, I became the most successful driver in the history of the Ford Fiesta Sprint Cup Benelux.",
  "about-p14": "I was also able to participate again in an endurance race with the C1 Benelux. This time it was the 24h of Spa. After leading the race for a long time, I eventually had to settle for 6th place out of 118 participants due to mechanical problems during the night, which was still a very strong result.",
  "about-p15": "As the icing on the cake, a first test day with the Porsche 992 Porsche GT3 Cup also took place at the Spa-Francorchamps circuit. The goal for the 2025 season immediately became clear!",
  "about-to-the-top": "Let's race to the top!",
  "tdb-racing-p1": "I can certainly rely on the experience of my father Eddy, who has already meant a lot in my racing career. In 1997, the racing team 'X-Pectmotorsport' was created under the leadership of my father Eddy De Backer.",
  "tdb-racing-p2": "I joined the team as a young driver and eventually became co-team owner and coach for the young pupils.",
  "tdb-racing-p3": "From 2023, the team and coaching platform continue under a new name 'TDB Racing'. TDB Racing is currently not just a team anymore but also the brand that I personally represent in the racing world. The team focuses mainly on the entry-level classes from karting to real motorsport on the major circuits. The brand follows along with my own motorsport dreams."
